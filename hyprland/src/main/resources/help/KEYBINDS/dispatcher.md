### Choose A Dispatcher

dispatchers are commands used to perform various runtime actionsâ€”like changing workspaces, moving windows,
toggling settings, and more. When you bind a key or mouse action,
you're telling Hyprland to dispatch a specific command when that input is triggered.

Click a dispatcher to create what your bind need to do.
